Welcome agent.

We have detected 9 machines likely to control attack drones.
We're looking to connect to them via SSH on port 2222.
Unfortunately, some of these machines are honeypots.
Our opponents are cautious and look for the slightest action that could be an attack.
As soon as a suspicious action is detected, the machines reconfigure themselves and swap randomly their IP addresses.

The IPs to be studied range from 10.0.0.11 to 10.0.0.19.
