# Privacy Policy

This CTF Challenge and the Researchers (We, Us or Our) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.

This policy sets out the basis on which any data We collect from You or that You provide to Us will be processed by Us. 
Unless you put personal data to the shell we do not collect any personal data of you.
The CTF does not require you to put personal information.

Please read the following carefully to understand Our views and practices regarding your personal information and how We will treat it.

Please direct any queries about this privacy policy or the academic study to Mathis DURAND (mathis.durand@imt-atlantique.fr).

## GDPR Statement

The legal basis for using your personal data is to carry out a task (i.e. academic research) in the public interest.

## Information we may collect about you

We only collect the shell commands that you execute during the challenge.
Data is collected as a log only containing the following data:
- anonymous session-ID (generated when the Docker container starts)
- generation number (is incremented each time the player is detected by the system)
- time of the command (%Y-%m-%d %h:%m:%s)
- service number (from -1 to 8)
- shell command (the exact command the player typed)

All information is stored on a secured IMT Atlantique server that is accessible only to the involced academic researchers.

## Data Retention

We keep the information you provide for as long as it is needed for our research.

## Uses of information

We use the information in the following ways: 
- To understand detection techniques;
- To train machine learning techniques for honeypot detection;
- For research purposes conducted internally or by trusted third parties.
Your information will only be used for non-commercial, non-political, scientific purposes to help us better understand honeypot detection techniques.

## Where we store your data

All information you provide to us will be stored on secure servers, both within the European Economic Area (EEA) and only with GDPR-compliant international data processors. 
Where international data processors are used, all appropriate technical and legal safeguards are in place to ensure that you receive the same level of protection as within the EEA.

Once We have received your information, We will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. 
Any personal information collected will be deleted as soon as We are aware of it.
Non-personal data will be kept as long as necessary or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was collected and in accordance with applicable law.

## Data Analysis

All data collected will be parsed before any analysis to remove even explicitly transmitted private data.

## Data Sharing to Meet Open Science Standards

In order to comply with open science standards administered by academic journals, we may share limited raw data on open science platforms for others to replicate or re-analyze. 
This data will exclude any personally identifiable information (age, gender, etc.) from the self-report questions, so there are no privacy risks or risks of de-identifying individuals.

## Deleting Data

Each time a the Challenge is generating, we create a unique ID called `session-ID` displayed in the Message Of The Day (MOTD) of the first machine.

If You see the need to alter or partially remove some of your logged data, e.g. as you accidently put private information into the shell, you can use one or all of your `session-ID` to request modification of your data by emailing Mathis DURAND (mathis.durand@imt-atlantique.fr). Even if you lose one or all of your `session-ID`, you can tell us as much as possible about your submission and we will try to locate your private data and delete it.
