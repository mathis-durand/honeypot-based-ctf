## GDPR Statement

No personal data 
The legal basis for using your personal data is to carry out a task (i.e. academic research) in the public interest.

## Information we may collect about you

We do not seek to collect or store any personal data that would.
We will only collect shell commands that you choose to type during the challenge and in the container shell if you agree to participate to this challenge.
Data is collected as a log.
Logs contain:
- session-ID (generated when the Docker container starts)
- generation number (is incremented each time the player is detected by the system)
- time of the command (%Y-%m-%d %h:%m:%s)
- service number (from -1 to 8)
- shell command (the exact command the player typed)
No other data will be stored.
Please, do not enter any personal in shell commands.
All information we collect is stored on a IMT Atlantique server accessible only to academic researchers.

## Data Retention

We will keep the information you provide for as long as it is needed for the study.

## Uses of information

We use the information we hold about you in the following ways: 
- To model attacker behaviors;
- To model detection techniques;
- To train machine learning techniques for honeypot detection;
- for research purposes conducted internally or by trusted third parties.
Your information will only be used for non-commercial, non-political, scientific purposes to help us better understand honeypot detection techniques.

## Where we store your data

All information you provide to us will be stored on secure servers, both within the European Economic Area (EEA) and only with GDPR-compliant international data processors. 
Where international data processors are used, all appropriate technical and legal safeguards are in place to ensure that you receive the same level of protection as within the EEA.

Once We have received your information, We will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. 
Any personal information collected will be deleted as soon as possible.
Non-personal data will be kept as long as necessary or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was collected and in accordance with applicable law.

## Data Analysis

All data collected will be parsed before any analysis to ensure privacy. 

## Data Sharing to Meet Open Science Standards

In order to comply with open science standards administered by academic journals, we may share limited raw data on open science platforms for others to replicate or re-analyze. 
This data will exclude any personally identifiable information (age, gender, etc.) from the self-report questions, so there are no privacy risks or risks of de-identifying individuals.

## Deleting Data

Each time a the Challenge is generating, we create a unique ID called `session-ID` displayed in the Message Of The Day (MOTD) of the first machine.
If you wish to delete your data, you can use one or all of your `session-ID` to request deletion of your data by emailing Mathis DURAND (mathis.durand@imt-atlantique.fr) within one year of completing the study. If you lose one or all of your `session-ID`, you can tell us as much as possible about your submission and we will try to locate it and delete it.

Data protection legislation gives you a number of rights in relation to your personal data, including but not limited to the right to access information held about you.
